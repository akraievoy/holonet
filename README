Features of this project:
 - an API for complex networks, aiming to be performant, but not yet profiled/compared with competition;
 - several metrics implemented over the former API, most notable are EigenGap/EigenVector metrics;
 - several random models to generate complex networks;
 - configurable/chainable Spring-based experiments, with a runner harness;
 - experiment configuration allows to profile a metric against several input parameters (multi-axis parameter spaces);
 - persistence of experiment results into an H2 database;
 - tab-separated-values export for any scalar metric for any experiment; 
 - configurable Pajek exports for network/vector metrics for any experiment;
 - DHT simulation environment with environment modelled via random complex network models;
 - DHT API layering coherent with Common API description;
 - several versions of Chord protocol, P-Grid protocol still on the way;
 - a simple framework to run Genetic Optimization over a network with metric-based constraints;
